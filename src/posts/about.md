# Hello,

I'm frontend developer, Sukyeong Park.<br>
This is my personal blog, writing down some stuffs that gave me sudden insight or AHA! moment.
<br>
<br>
I'm not that diligent to document everyday or to write continuous contents. I'll just record items that I want to remember for a long time. Most of them are going to be based on question 'Why?' and paraphrased in my own word.
